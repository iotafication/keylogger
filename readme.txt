This is a keylogger, I made this program in C# during my free time in 6th semester. Whenever you run this program it would store all the keystroke in txt file and to disable it you have to go to task manager and disable WindowsLocalProcess and I named this because not to make it obvious like keylogger, hacker___log and etc. Although There is nothing wrong to store keystroke on your own PC.
